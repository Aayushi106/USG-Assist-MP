# Why Madhya Pradesh Needs This (State-Specific Justification)

Madhya Pradesh faces some of India’s most serious diagnostic access gaps:

1. 48+ districts have shortage of radiologists
2. USG imaging is widely used but under-interpreted
3. Mixed-language Hindi–English medical reports create OCR difficulties
4. Patients often travel 40–80 km for follow-ups
5. High maternal mortality in tribal regions requires early detection
6. Government hospitals lack digital record systems
7. PHCs & CHCs cannot store or search patient reports effectively

This solution improves MP’s healthcare ecosystem by:

- Digitizing USG records instantly  
- Helping non-specialist doctors interpret findings  
- Supporting early maternal risk detection  
- Enabling telemedicine and remote specialists  
- Reducing patient travel burden  
- Ensuring consistent screening quality  

This directly contributes to SDG-3 (Good Health) and aligns with *Viksit Bharat 2047*.
